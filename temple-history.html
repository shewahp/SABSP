<section class="about">
<p align="left"><b>Shri Bhuvaneshwari</b> Shri Bhuvaneshwari temple at Souterpet, Mangaluru was constructed in 2007 by his holiness <b>Shri Praveen Matsyendranath Baba</b> who is serving as the Dharmadhikari for this spiritual institution Shri Adhishakthi Bhuvaneshwari Adhinatha Siddapeeta.</p> 
<br>
<p align="left">The ancestries of Supreme Mother at the current location dates to thousands of years into the past. Presence of superlative divinity at the place was emphasised by many Yogis, Saints and local deityâ€™s which led to Ashtamangala Prashne (a complex and sacred form of Vedic astrology to derive accurate information from the past). It was revealed that the Divine entity present was <b>Adi-Parashakti</b> herself Shri Bhuvaneshwari Devi. It was also discovered that a disciple of his holiness <b>Shri Gurudev Goraksha Nath</b> established Mother Divine in the form of a stone thousands of years ago and attained Samadhi (a state of profound and utterly absorptive contemplation of the Absolute Divine).</p> 
<br>
<p align="left">Pran Pratishtha (A ritual that involves establishing life force into a deity's idol by chanting mantras and performing consecration ceremonies, making the inanimate form a living representation of the divinity for worship) of Shri Bhuvaneshwari into the new idol was completed in 2007. Guru Paduka "Sandals of the Guru" symbolizing the Guru's wisdom, grace, and guidance was installed besides the sanctum sanctorum. 
<br>
<p align="left">The highlight of the temple is a <b>3-Dimensional Sri Chakra</b> (a sacred geometric design that symbolizes the Cosmos and Supreme Mother Divine) installed on top of the sanctum sanctorum. <b>Shri Lakshmi Bhu Varaha Swamy, Kaal Bhairav</b> and <b>Panchmukhi Hanuman</b> are the other presiding deities in the temple along with <b>Shri Ganesh</b> and <b>Shri Karthikeya</b>.</p> 
<br>
<p align="left">Shri Bhuvaneshwari Devi is revered as the "Queen of the Universe" and one of the Ten Maha-Vidyas (Great Wisdoms). The name Bhuvaneshwari is made up of two words, <b>Bhuvan</b> and <b>Ishwari</b>. Bhuvan denotes all the worlds or the universe, and Ishwari is the ruler. Bhuvaneshwari is thus the queen of the worlds and its sovereign ruler. The holy Vedas hail her as Aditi, the infinite and all-encompassing Mother, who holds the entire space in her cosmic womb. Thus, the universe itself is her divine body, that is, she herself is the universe, while her infinite self, resides in all the living things in it. She kindles divinity in beings, and her presence makes the living things, the very representations of her own self.</p> 
<br>
<p align="left">Bhuvaneshwari is thus, cosmos personified. Regarded as the earliest form of divine energy, she is a powerhouse, yet she also remains an embodiment of love, mercy and kindness. She regards earthly beings as her own children, gets pleased with sincere prayers and bestows her generous blessings on them. Her love is not of the usual possessive kind, but is all pervasive that frees us from illusion, attachment, and suffering. Her worship promotes a cosmic vision and opens a universal understanding of divinity. She grants devotees a captivating personality and all conquering success. bestows them with a variety of benefits, like health, wealth and fortune. She can also remove obstacles, and give courage, confidence, sensitivity, sense of responsibility and emotional maturity. She also protects devotees against all negative energies.</p>
